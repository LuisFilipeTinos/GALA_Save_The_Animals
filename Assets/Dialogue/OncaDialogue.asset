  dialogue:
  - Oh! Finally someone came to release me. You took too long, young human.
  - I am the jaguar and I am starving. I'm a carnivorous animal, so I have to hunt
    other animals to feed myself, did you know?
  - After all, I have to stay well fed to remain the biggest feline in the Americas.
  - I'm also a mammal, that is, I fed on milk when I was a baby, just like you.
  - Did you know that I am an incredible hunter and swimmer? I can hunt even in places
    with a lot of water. Cool, right?
  - It's a shame that humans don't care about me and because of that I'm almost threatened
    with extinction. This means that one day there may be no jaguars.
  - This is sad, but you seem smart, human! I'm counting on you to help save us from
    extinction.
  - Now go, you've been standing here too long. Good luck!
