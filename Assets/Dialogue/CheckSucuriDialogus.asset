  dialogue:
  - You are very smart, little adventurer! But look, there are hunters out front.
  - To get past them, you can't let them see you and, to do so, you must dodge them
    to get to the cage.
  - If they see you, you go back to the beginning of the challenge, that is, here
    where we are. Did you understand?
  - Don't forget to go to the biggest tree, in the center of the forest, once you
    let go and talk to all my friends!
  - Good luck!
