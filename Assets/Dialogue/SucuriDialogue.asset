  dialogue:
  - Just look! A human saved me, how wonderful. Hahahaha...
  - You are small!
  - Compared to me, one of the biggest snakes in the world, who isn't?
  - I am the green anaconda. I'm a carnivore, so I eat other animals.
  - Did you know that I can live up to thirty years? I have plenty of time to visit
    many places and animals.
  - I'm a swimmer, so in addition to moving across land, I can move through rivers.
    To help me move, find food and other snakes, I use my tongue.
  - I'm amazing, right? But get going, human.
