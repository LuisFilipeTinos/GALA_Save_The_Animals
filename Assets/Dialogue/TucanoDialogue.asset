  dialogue:
  - Hey! You came to save me!? Phew, I was tired of this cage. I thought I was going
    to be trapped in this cage for longer!
  - I'm used to flying freely and the hunters made me think I could no longer fly
    through the forest.
  - "By the way, I am the Toco Toucan, also known as Tucanu\xE7u, the largest species
    of toucan in Brazil. Cool, right?"
  - I love fruits, insects and eggs! Speaking of which, it made me hungry! Being
    trapped in this cage left me craving some berries.
  - "In addition to the forest, I live in savannahs and cap\xF5es. My species nests
    in holes, trees, ravines and termite mounds."
  - Wow, all this talk has made me thirsty. Now I'm thirsty and hungry. The best
    time for a meal hehehe.
  - Thank you very much, human! I can fly free again! See you later and good luck!
