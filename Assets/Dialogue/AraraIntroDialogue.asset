  dialogue:
  - Hello! I'm the blue macaw and I need help to save my friends!
  - What's happening is that three of my friends were trapped in cages by hunters
    who invaded the forest and I need you to release them.
  - But you don't need to worry, I'll be with you all the time.
  - When you get close to the places where the hunters are with my friends, you will
    see a tree that keeps appearing and disappearing.
  - With it, you can call me to tell you how to get past these bad men and get to
    the cages...
  - And one more thing, the forest is big, so you should look for the place where
    each of my friends are.
  - Oh! Before I forget. To move around, you can press the "W" key or the up arrow
    key to move forward.
  - To move to the right, you can press the "D" key or the right arrow key.
  - To move to the left, you can press the "A" key or the left arrow.
  - To go backwards, you can press the "S" key or the down arrow key.
  - You can also move the mouse around to look at things.
  - And press "F" or "Right Ctrl" to release the animals, interact with them and
    call me near the trees that appear and disappear.
  - "But don't worry if you don't remember all the commands. You can press the \"ESC\"
    key to pause the game and click the \u201CAbout\u201D button to remember what
    each key does."
  - After releasing all my friends, go to the biggest tree in the forest to finish
    your mission.
  - Don't forget to chat with my friends to learn about them!
  - Now you are prepared to begin your adventure! Good luck, young adventurer!
